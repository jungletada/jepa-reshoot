    PROMPT="An elderly couple is seated on a wooden bench in Baleen, deeply engrossed in reading a magazine. The man, wearing a white polo shirt and dark trousers, has sunglasses on his head, while the woman, in a striped top and beige pants, leans on him. They are surrounded by a tranquil suburban setting, featuring a white SUV, a blue sedan, and a U.S. Post Office.

    PROMPT="A man in a blue hoodie and green pants, holding a bouquet of yellow flowers, walks alongside a woman in a beige trench coat and white pants, accompanied by a small white dog on a red leash, in front of a red brick building with large windows and black iron bars. The scene transitions to show a white SUV parked on the street, reflecting the bare branches of a tree and the building's facade, suggesting a peaceful urban setting. The couple and their dog continue their walk, passing by the parked SUV, under a clear sky, indicating a pleasant day in an urban environment."
elif [ $EXAMPLE == elderly-tennis ]; then

Initially, he is captured mid-stride, casting a long shadow. As time passes, he is shown in various poses, including standing with a tennis racket, preparing to serve, and finally, poised to serve with a red and black racket. His attire includes a light blue jacket and a cap with a green emblem. The setting transitions from a tranquil park to a more urban environment, with the late afternoon sun casting long shadows, indicating a peaceful yet active lifestyle."
elif [ $EXAMPLE == mountain-hike ]; then
    PROMPT="A solitary hiker, equipped with a backpack and trekking poles, traverses a rocky path in a tranquil, mountainous landscape, surrounded by leafless trees and sparse greenery under a partly cloudy sky. The hiker, dressed in dark attire, stands poised on a boulder, gazing at a majestic, snow-capped mountain peak. The scene, bathed in soft light, suggests it might be early morning or late afternoon. The hiker, now with a green jacket, continues their journey, embodying a sense of peaceful solitude and adventure in the serene wilderness."
elif [ $EXAMPLE == park-selfie ]; then
    PROMPT="A man with shoulder-length wavy hair, wearing a light blue shirt and teal t-shirt, captures a selfie with a woman in a pink bucket hat and white jacket, seated beside him on a wooden bench in a park. They are surrounded by lush greenery and a calm body of water, under a partly cloudy sky. The man points at the camera, ensuring they are both in the frame, while the woman smiles broadly, her eyes closed in joy. Their relaxed demeanor and the serene park setting reflect a moment of shared happiness and contentment."
elif [ $EXAMPLE == parkour ]; then

elif [ $EXAMPLE == snowboard ]; then
    PROMPT="A man wearing a black helmet, snow jacket, and gloves and dark blue snow pants is snowboarding down a path of snow, where the snow looks compact and already has many marks on it from previous snowboarders and skiers. As he snowboards he leaps up with the snowboard and does a 360 jump, flinging clouds of snow around his snowboard. Behind him is a hill or mountain of snow with rocks on it, surrounding the snowboard and skiing path. The scene seems to take place closer to sunset or sunrise, with a long shadow behind the snowboarder."
elif [ $EXAMPLE == soapbox ]; then
    PROMPT="A video of a man pushing a sky blue homemade cart with a man wearing a helmet and sitting on top of it and a red barrel at the front of the cart.
