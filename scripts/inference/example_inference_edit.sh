The woman, dressed in a cream coat and pink beanie, and the man, in a green jacket and dark pants, embrace and kiss, surrounded by the serene beauty of snow-covered trees. The car's open trunk, adorned with festive tassels, adds a celebratory touch to the scene. The couple's affectionate interactions, including tender embraces and a kiss, convey a deep connection and contentment amidst the tranquil winter landscape. There is also an identical black car to the left of the couple's black car, also with its trunk open, and turned slightly to the side."

To the left of the couple is an elderly couple who are seated on a wooden bench, reading a newspaper and then glancing over at the hugging couple. The wooden bench has its legs slightly buried in the snow, and the elderly couple's shoes are on the snow as well. The elderly man, wearing a white polo shirt and dark trousers, has sunglasses on his head, while the elderly woman, in a striped top and beige pants, leans on him."

They are the first person in the line of people in this funeral procession. The scene, set under an overcast sky, reflects a mood of reverence and final farewell.
