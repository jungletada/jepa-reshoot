He reacts with comedic exaggeration, pretending to be knocked backward by the force. The woman laughs as he continues the dramatic pose, stumbling away."

    PROMPT="In a conference room, a young woman wearing a white beanie and a black puffer jacket person stands and leans over a table, pointing to something in an open notebook. A young man sitting at the table looks at the book, then gestures with their hand as they look up. They then put their hand to their head, appearing to be thinking hard or feeling puzzled by the topic being discussed."

elif [ $EXAMPLE == hall-cartwheel ]; then
    PROMPT="A man stands in a brightly lit, modern hall with large windows in the background. He begins by raising his arms out to his sides, as if stretching. He then performs a quick, athletic cartwheel across a blue mat on the floor, moving from left to right. After completing the acrobatic move, he lands on his feet and straightens up."

He smiles and briefly raises his arms in a small celebratory gesture. He then lowers his hands to the table and begins to speak, gesturing as if he is explaining something. The setting appears to be an office or storage area with a large window overlooking other buildings."

The scene takes place in a meeting room or office, with a white whiteboard and other office chairs visible in the background."
